## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a seasoned software engineer with a Master's in Computer Science from the University of Buffalo. With an experience in building real-time, scalable applications, I specialize in NodeJs, Python, Java, and frameworks such as ExpressJS, Django, and Flask. I am skilled in deploying and managing applications using Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS among other technologies.
I have a passion for distributed systems and enjoy designing solutions that are not only effective but also resilient to failures.
